## Activity 5

Functional Requirement:

* I would like to add a feature where the website would take care of a wrong argument inputted into the search bar. At the moment, only valid inputs refresh the website so I would like to improve searching by displaying an error message asking the user to enter a correct input again.

Non-functional Requirement:

* Currently, the Education Pathways website lacks usability. I would like to improve this by making it visually appealing and giving it a certain style. The texts on the website are not separated from each other properly and clear boundaries should be added to allow users to distinguish between various courses displayed.
